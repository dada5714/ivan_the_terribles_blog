# Ivan's Blog

This is a performance improvement test on a blog of 100 posts, each with 100 comments and 100 replies. Currently added are infinite scrolling so that only the first 10 articles are loaded along with eager loading and caching. What is still needed is a "load comments" button for the comments.
